About

This is a simple 'console' like window manager intended to show just how easy
it can be to define a window manager of your own in the Arcan ecosystem.

The git history is arranged as a 'step by step' demonstration where each
commit adds some notable feature. Check the Arcan blog @ arcan-fe.com for
a write-up that explains the steps in further detail.

Use
===

Follow the normal setup / install instructions for arcan, and run with:

    arcan /path/to/console_wm/console

A fullscreen terminal should spawn, exiting that terminal should kill arcan
and the WM.
